# Hey, I'm Reem ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer and product lead with a soft spot for clean architecture and honest products.  
Iâ€™ve spent the last few years building SaaS platforms, leading small teams, and designing systems that scale securely.  

**Current project:** [configtrace](https://github.com/reemabdullah/configtrace) â€” a Rust-based tool to track and audit cloud configuration changes.  

**Previously:** Led the development of a sustainability-focused SaaS platform and its cybersecurity governance.  

Outside of code, I chase good stories â€” in books, in art, and sometimes in the systems we build.
